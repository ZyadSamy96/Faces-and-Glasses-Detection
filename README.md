# Faces-and-Glasses-Detection
Achieved face detection by utilizing OpenCV, applied deep learning to detect that the image contains glasses or not by using pretrained model ‚ÄúMobileNet-V2‚Äù to fine tune the performance.

# Steps of project 

## Data Exploration 
- 1- Diplay some samples of the Data 
- 2- Data Balance Check
- 3- Split the data into trainning folder and validation folder

## Building models

#### a) Conv Model
- 1- Used Data Augmentation 
- 2- Used Simple Architecture

#### b) Pre-Trained Model (MobileNet-V2)
- 1- Used Data Augmentation 
- 2- Freezed Conv Base 

#### c) Fine Tunning Stage
- 1- Unfreeze Some Layers

###### Note that first 20 epochs concerned with stage (a) and the last 20 epochs concerned with stage (b)

#                                                           Hi üëã, I'm Zyad Samy
In this project, I trained multible machine learning models using 2D landmarks and the AFLW2000 dataset which consists of 2000 images annotated with image-level 68-point 3D facial landmarks in a variety of head poses and Mediapipe library that extract 468 points ( X, Y) to estimate the rotation axis (pitch,yaw,roll) for the head in real time
